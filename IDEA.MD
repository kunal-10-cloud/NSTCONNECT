1. Project Title
NSTCONNECT – A College-Only Social Networking Platform

2. Your Name & Roll Number
Aditya Bijalwan – 2024-B-07062006A

3. Problem Statement
In many colleges, there is no dedicated platform for students to connect socially and professionally within the campus community. Communication often happens across scattered WhatsApp groups, Instagram pages, or informal chats, making it hard to discover peers, share updates, or maintain meaningful connections. A centralized, secure, and college-exclusive platform can improve networking, collaboration, and communication among students.

4. Proposed Solution / Idea
A web and mobile application exclusively for our college where students can create profiles, send and accept friend requests, post updates, and chat in real time with their approved friends. This platform will centralize campus connections, making it easier for students to network, share updates, and stay engaged with peers.

5. Key Features

User profiles with editable details and profile pictures.

Friend request system with accept/reject functionality.

Posting system for text and image updates visible only to friends.

Real-time private chat with approved friends (Socket.io).

Search functionality to find students by name or department.

6. Target Users / Audience
Students and faculty of [Your College Name].
